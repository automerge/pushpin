/* Board Grid Utilities
 * (Please be careful before re-using these, they're somewhat idiosyncratic.)
 *
 * The board has a grid, and we treat movement on the grid very carefully.
 *
 * There are two kinds of elements to the grid: positions and dimensions.
 * Positions (composed of coordinates) have an X/Y value, and are generally
 *    snapped to the nearest grid point.
 * Dimensions (composed) of width and height have +1 added to their snap
 * values to ensure that they sit on top of grid lines instead of just within them.
 *
 * It's also important to note that dimensions (width and height) might be "null".
 * Null, as a value, indicates that we should allow the inner content to set width
 * and/or height.
 *
